had a dream that i was at like an amusement park or something with some of my coworkers, including \[Jan] (head of my department), and i ended up having to use a restroom there that was…. a terrifying experience. im a bit shaken. it was multiuse, but it had no like stalls, like the toilets and shit were just out, and it didnt have any locking doors or anything, just a curtain at the entrance. i freaked out when one of my coworkers tried to enter because… how could i not? im an unshaved, deepvoiced, underdressed, undersocialized trans girl, and these are my fucking coworkers, obligated by law to be nice to me. Jan ended up getting impatient and entering anyways, with a few other people who occupied the other toilets (no stalls!!! wtf) and did their business, and talked the whole time, and it was fucking terrifying. (it was also maybe slightly thrilling?? i got slightly hard, but thats prob cus i woke up and had to pee like crazy.) after the event was done, i struggled finding a bus home because all the routes were changed number and i felt kinda bad but they were accepting of that too. the first issue was likely on my mind because our company has one key for the bathroom on my floor of the office building, so i usually get some amount of peace in there, cause atp ive stopped caring what total strangers, like the ones in other companies on our floor, think. BUT today, our HR person, who i guess has another key, went in to the bathroom while i was washing my hands, and like she acknowledged my existence, she gave me a glance, we made eye contact im p sure, but her facial expression didn't really deviate from a sort of RBF, but she doesn't have RBF to my knowledge. as stupid as it is to say, the bathroom is one of the most terrifying experiences as an out (clocky-ass) transfem who puts like 30% effort at most into changing her voice and isn't great about shaving everyday. fuck, i didnt even wear a bra today, i just hoped my oversized sweater helped me?? i dont know how to be a girl. i dont know the ins and outs of it. the bus thing was also a bit scary, cause im HORRIBLY reliant on public transit in my day to day (i have a three hour commute to work and a three hour commute home. and i dont exactly try to hide it. i feel…. almost movementally challenged, a burden for when we have events that everyone's driving out to. fuck, one of my coworkers drove me out to the fuckin live scan an hour into my first day and it was the most embarrassing fucking feeling ever, like okay, thank you for driving me mom, i won't stay out for too long. it kinda ties back into the gender thing almost, because its just another facet of my being The Other in the workplace, likei show up everyday, under dressed for business casual, and i'm weird and wiggly and neurodivergent (that's a whole nother thing!!!). idk, clearly this shit's been on my mind and i've kinda tried avoiding it.
