I don't know if this gender identity thing is working for me KSJDNBKJV. I was doing a bit of looking early this morning about Snoot Game and Goodbye Volcano High, because I'm not sure if the first is transphobic (whole thing I won't get into). However, reading about the story, of a nonbinary character who detransitions back to a cisgender female sort of made something... hit for me. Or at the very least it forced me to consider something that's been in the back of my mind.

I'm not sure how much I like being a girl, at least right now in the moment. Like I DEFINITELY hated being a cis guy, that shit sucked, but I'm not sure I'm full-on girl. In the end, where I land exactly doesn't matter too much, a term is a term. But the transitioning process does have some things that leave a lot to be desired. I don't think I was expecting, or wanting, for my breasts to grow in as much as they are. I DEFINITELY didn't want my muscles to deteriorate as much as they have, and I know I can work against that, but it's really difficult, it feels Sisyphusian. 

I'm not sure I want society to see me as a full-on girl either. I think initially I started the full-on binary transition because I know that most of the general public will either only see me as a binary girl or a binary boy, but disregarding what other people think, I'm not sure what I'd want. I've always found the scenecore scene and aesthetic to be where I've most felt at home, though it's too difficult to dress like that everyday, at least for me. And regarding that only like half of strangers see me as a girl anyways, I'm not sure that continuing my transition beyond this point would be much worth it. 

I kind of wonder, if society didn't have this need to shove people into male or female, what would I be?? Scene, right? That feels like what I want to be, what I want to be seen as. 

I do gotta say I quite like having my shitty facial and body hair grow less, it's a huge plus. I HATE my facial and body hair so fucking much, it's why I even wanted to transition in the first place. If I had known about and been regularly participated in laser hair removal or the other options, would I even have come this far with my transition? 

Partially related, I seem to have a habit of jumping into things, thinking that diving fully into something is the only way I can be happy. I'm considering being a musicology doctorate, but now I'm not so sure about that. I don't know, I still probably want to do that, I think it'd be a lot of fun, even if I don't necessarily need to for my career or anything. Which almost makes me more sure that stopping my transition would be the right thing to do.

And another thing, I think what didn't help is that I don't know how much I'd want to use pronouns other than he/him, they/them, and she/her. I tried they/them for a while, and I felt absolutely nothing. I get quite excited when a stranger uses she/her for me, but I feel a similar disconnect when my online oomfie [REDACTED] uses she/her for me. I guess I'm not sure what other options there is for what I wanna be? I'm not sure if using neopronouns would be right for me, it feels like that would feel... uncomfortable? Or nounself? Maybe they'd both be something I'd have to try. It just doesn't feel natural to me. 

Here's kind of the embarassing thing as well - I don't really know how to use neopronouns LMAOOOO. I've only ever known one person IRL who at least outwardly uses neopronouns, and she (using this for her to keep her, and myself, anonymous) also uses she/her and they/them. So I kinda don't have a good benchmark. I'll get searching.
