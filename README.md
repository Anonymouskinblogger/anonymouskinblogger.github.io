A space for me to speak my shit, and maybe anthropologists, sociologists, etc. can take from my experiences.

### Who am I?
I'm going to use the name Maple here, I think, for anonymity. The name was chosen from a "top dog names" website. But also it's the name of Jayrnski's cute deer OC, a fact I only realized after deciding on the name. But it's sticking.... so Maple it is.

### What are you????
I'm a critter. add more later im  sleeep yyy
