I've been struggling hella hard as of late with feeling like I really don't fit in. I feel like such a letdown to my partners because of it. It really is kind of a struggle for me to be social? In a way that I feel like my partners (all three of us are self-diagnosed with autism) don't seem to struggle with, at least outwardly. It feels weird to say, but it feels like the two of them get along more neurotypically than me, especially because one is so attached to the hip to the other. It feels like there's so much that I miss between them, and it's so hard to remember that all three of ours relationships are important separately as 1:1 relationships as the whole throuple is together, so it always feels like when I see either of them, the other is there.

The sucky thing for me, meanwhile, is there is just not enough fucking time in the day. Even right now when I'm basically unemployed, or I guess, self-employed but not making money yet. The job I have for myself, essentially research, is basically boundless, and I always have like 8 projects going on with it, in addition to having so many movies, albums, poems, games, books, visual art, I wanna check out, and I have other projects I want to do that are for fun, as well as hanging out with friends which I so rarely do. And I just never get around to any of that other stuff cause I still have a lot of fun with those 8 projects! But it sucks, because I can spend entire weeks Working On Things and basically spend no time with my partners, checking out the art I want to check out, or relax. And there's not enough time in the day.

It's tough not to look at how my partners handle their work-relax-play-social-enrichment-etc balance from the outside with jealousy, and as always, the grass is always greener on the other side, but I hardly see them struggle with any of this, it seems like they're content doing whatever. Key does a lot of work as well, but not as statistically as me, and she also spends time talking to friends, playing games, listening to music, and hangs out with my other partner all the time. This other partner, who I'll be calling Sirius (they/he), because of his loyalty and interest in witchery and other such fun, seems to live a life with a lot of play and relaxation (he has weed gummies most nights), however they're also an incredibly dedicated worker, both to projects around the house, and artistic projects of their own. And of course, these two spend what looks like hours together everyday.

I also just feel really weird interacting with them, and other people. Key's annoyingly sharp wit bites at me any time I feel like I've got any sort of upper hand in playful teasing, and any comeback my slow-thinking brain makes gets fucking ricocheted with ease, or just blows up in my face. And of course, Sirius is always dickriding Key, so I get double the Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, since he always takes her side. I don't believe I've mentioned it here before either, but Sirius, and to a lesser extent, Key also take issue with the frequency and tryhard-ness of the jokes I make as well, something that pains me all the time. I struggle with any kind of social interaction that isn't based on such pleasantries, small talk, and constant good-natured joking, so it's just kind of my automatic mode. This grates upon them, because: A, the jokes aren't always funny; B, I'm constantly reaching; C, I imagine it's tough and annoying having conversation with someone who can only speak in humor; probably more. It is a problem I have that I want to improve on, but I kind of really don't know how. Holding conversation doesn't feel natural to me, it always feels like I'm acting, or there's some kind of channel or flow state that others can get into that I can't. Every conversation I have feels like I have to be so, so intentional, as if I'm on a stage doing improv, trying to find the best routes to move conversation forward, be pleasant and humorous, while whoever I'm talking to just kind of... does it naturally. 

I really don't want to use the NPC comparison because that dehumanizes real people with real lives and emotions fears and struggles real as mine, it risks further alienating myself, and I just.... fucking hate the vibe of it. Whenever someone I'm talking to calls anyone in real life an NPC, or says someone listens to "coworker music" or something of the sort, I want to cease talking to them immediately. HOWEVER, as much as I hate this comparison, it sometimes does feel like interactions with friends, colleagues, my partners, end up going this way, with pressured timed prompts on my end, and near-automatic repartee from them. I draw the line at calling this gap "NPC" in anyway, because it's not that other peoples' thought processes are less sophisticated, less important, or any such thing, I think the problem lies more in something I lack - maybe the trust in the other person to freely be myself, or the experience with social dynamics, or that I've been scarred too many times by past friendships that every interaction I have feels I'm playing with fire. It's far from that everyone else around me are NPCs, simply put, I'm just neurotic and overthink every small back-and-forth more than is at least visible to me. 

So I have a firm understanding of this issue of mine, the problem then is just how do I solve this. How do I let myself into a secret society when I don't know where the front door is? How do I figure out how to interact and relax in social settings like most people can when the only brain I know is mine? How do I even go about talking about this with anyone, when I can barely let my guard down enough to stop making surface-level jokes forever? I feel so alone. I'm going to see if I can discuss this with my therapist. I really hope that with all my scrawls I have here, that someone who needs to see this will see this, and know that they're not the only one that feels like this, because that's the horrible thing about this - the crushing loneliness.

P.S., this is why I also have a hard time whenever people say they don't trust therapy. Two of the most mentally ill bitches I've ever known HATED being therapised, and while I can empathize with people who might have trauma from abusive therapists or something of the such - I do not think that anyone can handle 100% of their problems on their own. You need to have a human connection with someone else whose entire job is understanding and helping people, so that they may hear your struggles, and they may relate their experience and offer a multitude of perspectives you haven't considered, or moreover, can't even consider. The only perspective you can truly know is your own, and stewing in that (ironically, from my experience with these folks) leads to you being totally convinced that your perspective is the only one and the truest one, you alienating yourself, developing unhealthy coping mechanisms when more workable solutions are within reach, and more. BUUUUTTTTTT again, this is only my perspective, and I can't truly know what they've gone through. This shit's so fucking hard........
