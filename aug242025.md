I have to wonder how much of my social experience is shaped by my autism. I mean, I assume I have autism, I've never been formally diagnosed, but it feels like the safest bet at this point. And in regards to the first point, it really feels like I have to get a Masters Degree in Philosophy to even understand how basic human interaction and conversation and friendship works. 

I watched an episode of House M.D. earlier today with one of my partners, who I'll call Key (any pronouns) for her intense dedication to understanding humanity. The episode was The Social Contract, and like a previous episode we watched this week, No Reason, which I may talk about another time, this one had a big impact on me. It was something I'd been thinking about for a while, but I had never really had time to pay a ton of attention to because I was busy at the time, I believe. 

Specifically, the problem is with a Social Contract, and not necessarily the same Social Contract that Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and others talked about (CAUSE YES I DID HAVE TO LOOK UP PHILOSOPHY SURROUNDING THIS DURING THE FALLOUT FROM THIS MESS!!), but rather, a different kind of Social Contract that the House M.D. episode proposes - one of intrusive and extrusive thoughts, masking your true feelings towards something that someone you care about is passionate about, or bluntly, pretending to care about something for the sake of people-pleasing.

It was something that hit really hard to me, and is something I've struggled with, especially with my online best friend from my Aug 15, 2025 entry, who henceforth in this blog, I'll be calling Nova (she/it, I believe?) for her interest in space and occasional alienkin identity. She and I call frequently, and while it's my best friend I've ever had and we get along quite well, she'll often infodump about some of her interests, several of which I'm not driven about as she is, though I try indulging her because I enjoy her company and giving her the space to do so. As I am an autistic son of a bitch often running on few social spoons and trying to be as authentic as I can around her, I sometimes find myself being a bit snarky, dismissive, flippant, towards its rambles (calling her a nerrrrd, the "oh my goddd" response, etc. not necessarily a mean-hearted response, but a teasing remark), which always makes me feel terrible. So, often, I tend to lean too far in the other direction, and coddle, reply overenthusiastically, and just try to match her energy, which in itself is a way of masking I do with friends I'm not as close with, and a method that exhausts me far more than it probably does to most. 

This could also tie into a flawed value I've baked into myself a bit, that I can only be friends with people who share similar interests to me, or I can only talk to people about things they're interested in. Too often, I go to conventions (furry, brony, otherkin) and try to make friends with people who are into similar fandoms as me, but find myself never messaging them once the con's over... it hurts :(

I'm not quite sure what to do with all this... I think it's clear to me that I need to be more clear to others when I'm running low on spoons - energy (whether physically or socially) - and dedicate time to things that are more suited for myself by myself. I think I also need to work on finding a comfortable middle ground when friends talk about things I'm not interested, perhaps a flatter "I'm listening" than an overenthusiastic "THAT'S SO COOLL".
